Do the Following.
X 1.On home page we have two Buttons "Shop Now" and "Learn More". Where should these buttons lead to? whats common in ecommerce website. whatever you think is best considering our current pages and sections. Do it. but do it thoroughly dont leave anything out.
X 2.When the website loads initially the navbar most probably shows static values and then is replaced with actual categories from the database. this is a bug resolve it, we shouldnt be using static values here, we should wait for data to load from db.
X 3.Instead of view Product button on product cards we should show "add to cart" button, this should be done for featured products on the home page and it should also be done in when viewing products by any category in https://bayt-organic.vercel.app/products/x category, in similar urls.
X 4.when a product is added to cart we should open a popup on the right side of the screen that slides onto the screen from the right side. this should be more like a side bar on the right with all the cart items and total bill. it should have a cross button to close it and also a continue shopping button in the end to close it. Also clicking anywhere on the webpage outside this side bar should close this cart sidebar. i have attached the image for you to to take design reference from. Also Make sure all cart related buttons are working in the sidebar.
X 5.In the bottom we have NewsLetter on the home page. lets make a new collection model in db where we save all the emails that are entered there. Subscribe to newsletter should work from anywhere we have the subscribe to newsletter button. show a toast when someone clicks it after entering email.
X 6.These links should have the navbar working properly currenty they dont show the store navbar:
